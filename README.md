# Team-Profile
Generates a list of names and status from information prompted to the user by the command line about a project Team. 

# Technologies used
In this program, we use node.js and its `inquirer` package to store user input, and we also use `jest` to run unit testing. 

# Installation.
To run this program, you must install the required packages from npm. Here is a step-by-step guide.
1. Navigate to the correct folder/workspace that includes the correct package.json file. 
2. From you command line, gitbash, or terminal, invoke `npm install` and you should have to correct node modules. 
3. Now that you have the required dependancies, you are ready to begin the application. 
4. In your command line, run `index.js` to start.

# User Story
Upon launching the application, the user will be prompted, from the command line, questions that retain to the 
content of the Team that you are to input. The user will have to enter information such as 'Title', 'Name', and 'Email' etc.
Upon adding all the desired members of the team, starting with the manager, an `index.html` file will be created to neatly display all the members.
